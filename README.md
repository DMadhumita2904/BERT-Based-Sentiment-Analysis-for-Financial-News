```

## 📊 Dataset Preparation

The model is trained on a structured dataset that includes feedback or news sentences along with their corresponding sentiment labels.

### 🧾 Sample Dataset Format (`data.csv`)

| Sentence                                           | Sentiment |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| "Tesla announces record profits this quarter"      | positive  |
| "Market downturn affects tech stocks"              | negative  |
| "Fed maintains current interest rates"             | neutral   |

- **Sentence**: Represents user input or feedback.
- **Sentiment**: Label indicating the emotional tone (`positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`).

Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted and encoded in UTF-8 to avoid loading issues during training.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 🎯 Training the Model

```python
from train import FinancialSentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = FinancialSentimentAnalyzer()

# Train the model with your dataset
analyzer.train(
    data_path='data.csv',
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=16
)
```

### 🔍 Making Predictions

Once your model is trained and saved, you can easily load it and make sentiment predictions on financial news headlines or user feedback:

```python
# Load the trained model
analyzer = FinancialSentimentAnalyzer.load_model('./sentiment-analysis-model')

# Predict sentiment for a new sentence
news_headline = "Apple stocks surge after record-breaking iPhone sales"
prediction = analyzer.predict(news_headline)

print(f"Predicted Sentiment: {prediction}")
# Output: 🟢 Positive (0.92 confidence)
```

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

The following parameters were used during model training:

| 🔧 Parameter            | 📌 Value             |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Base Model             | `bert-base-uncased`  |
| Max Sequence Length    | `128`                |
| Batch Size             | `16`                 |
| Learning Rate          | `2e-5`               |
| Warmup Steps           | `500`                |
| Weight Decay           | `0.01`               |

These settings ensure a balance between performance and training stability using the BERT architecture.

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Model evaluation results on the training and validation sets:

| 🧪 Metric     | 🏋️‍♂️ Training | 🧪 Validation |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Accuracy     | 94.2%          | 89.7%         |
| F1-Score     | 93.8%          | 88.9%         |
| Precision    | 94.1%          | 89.2%         |
| Recall       | 93.5%          | 88.5%         |

These metrics indicate strong generalization performance and balanced prediction quality across classes.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

Here's what's next on our roadmap to elevate the project:

- 🚀 **Deploy as REST API**  
  Allow external applications to interact with the model via HTTP endpoints.

- 🧩 **Create Browser Extension**  
  Enable real-time sentiment analysis of financial news directly from web pages.

- 🌐 **Add Multi-lingual Support**  
  Expand capabilities to support sentiment analysis in multiple languages.

- 🎯 **Implement Confidence Thresholding**  
  Control predictions by filtering low-confidence outputs.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Develop Anomaly Detection for Market Manipulation**  
  Identify unusual sentiment spikes potentially linked to manipulative activity.
